eden_dialogue_4iqSieW,"Travelers to Parthix in the past? You mean besides Farr? Hmm... There is a tale of an ancient traveler who came here on an airship, but it is considered myth and not a historical fact.\nIt will take me some time to find the text in the Archive, come back later. In the meantime please consider exploring the rest of the Archives or Temple Prime and Farr's Arrival to learn more of our history.\nI will send a message to your PDA when I have located the text.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eden_dialogue_OGvaCa4,"I don't believe so, though you do seem familiar... Wait, you... No, you can't be him! You're the one who....\nI have something for you. <color=#ffff00>Make sure you got some room in your inventory.</color>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_4OG4sCG,Shhh. Don't say anything. I think I'm being watched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_G0OW9iW,"Nope, must be a funny coincidence. I've never been here before. Who? Me? Never! Honest!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_e8miaKC,"I completely understand. I don't know you and I never met you.\nIt is a complete coincidence that I happen to have limited edition posters with your name on it then. Here, have them, as a token of appreciation for uhh, visiting our world for the first time. Yeah, we like to give out posters here on Parthix.\n<color=#ffffff><i>The Archivist smiles and hands you a bundle of limited edition posters.</i></color>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eden_dialogue_GGueOWu,Fine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_G0a0CWS,He wandered Parthix seeking audiences with leaders. Before he left he built a stone statue. The statue has long since been destroyed but the inscription was recorded in the book.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_0uG8iuK,What did the inscription say?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_0eOqa6m,"<i><color=#9fa19b>The people of Parthix are divided but have much potential. Primitive, but resourceful. They cannot aid me, however, and I have received word that I am being given a new task. I am to travel to a moon where crystal meets the sky and keep watch there, waiting for the day the relic of the stars is found.</color></i>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_Ga2iGSi,I see. Thank you for this history lesson.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_eWW0KuG,"No please, it is I who should be thanking you! You have solved the mystery of who this traveler was and confirmed the myth was real. We have encountered several crystalline moons that fit the description in the inscription. Perhaps you can continue your search there.\nYou have added to our history today, and for that I am thankful. Please, have this gift, may it serve you well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eden_dialogue_9KCaCuu,I don't need any help. Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_C08omW4,How does all this work?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_qmCqE0C,"@d0Very simple. As a neutral party, the Trader Guild is often contracted out by the other factions to transfer cargo.\nIn turn, we contract out some of the deliveries to third parties such as you. Of course you probably want to know how you can make money from this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_m0aG840,What do I need to do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_KOCu8ae,"@d0Head to a Distribution Headquarters in a Trading Station sector inside Trader Guild space.\nTrading Station sectors show up on the solar system map as a white station symbol.\nSpeak to the traders there for the faction you want to deliver to and pay any collateral that is asked.\n@p9Then head to a Distribution Center in a Trading Station sector in the territory of the faction you are delivering to. Sell it to them to get back your collateral plus a small fee for your services.\n@p9A certain reputation level is required before you are allowed to fulfill delivery contracts. \nSmall packages require neutral with the Trader Guild.\nMedium packages require friendly.\nLarge packages require honored.\nYou will also need to be neutral, friendly, or honored with the faction you are delivering to, so double check your reputation before accepting a delivery contract.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eden_dialogue_88WHImT,I want to ask something else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
